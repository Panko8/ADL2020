# ADL2020

ADL2020 Final Project

A transfer learning model to monitor social distance, with the help of pretrained YOLOv4 model

- The pytorch implementation of YOLOv4 is modified from <https://github.com/Tianxiaomo/pytorch-YOLOv4>
- The pretrained YOLOv4 model and cfg is the same as <https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet>
- Our original dataset: Kitti dataset Object Tracking Evaluation 2012 <http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_tracking.php>

## Warning: Before running any script, please adjust global_variable.py to fit your data location to avoid any annoying error. For example, all_db.pt should be placed in DATASET_HUMAN_PATH directory.

## Description

1. Please download YOLO model weight (251MB) from <https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights>
2. Please download YOLO model config file (14KB) from <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov4.cfg>
3. Please download our downstream model weight file (13MB) from <https://drive.google.com/file/d/15nD_eziGoA-8DDmJDW_bUVOFP1lJqfKo/view?usp=sharing>
4. Please download demo_images (308MB) used in demo.py from <https://drive.google.com/file/d/12uEKbU5kEELAqEOJhG5dBmqwHEHNUNvN/view?usp=sharing>
5. To run train.py (inference doesn't need this), you need the training dataset. It is recommended to download parsed dataset, rather than construct them all by yourself. (If you download this, you can safely ignore KITTI_LABEL_DIR and KITTI_VIDEO_DIR in global_variable.py) The parsed dataset can be downloaded from <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lzz4P0IMMMN7gy1KhJvaIebRXAcIXkct/view?usp=sharing>. This file can also be generated by our_dataset.py, but you need to download the whole Kitti dataset and edit 2 Kitti related variable in global_variable.py
6. After downloading those files, please make sure you modify those variables listed in global_variable.py

- KITTI_LABEL_DIR: a directory with many Kitti labels txt files.
- KITTI_VIDEO_DIR: a directory with many Kitti videos (a folder with images)
- YOLO_WEIGHT_FILE_PATH: a file downloaded in Description-(1)
- YOLO_CFG_FILE_PATH: a file downloaded in Description-(2)
- DATASET_HUMAN_PATH: a **directory** where the file downloaded in Description-(5) is placed in

## Training

1. Adjust some variable at the top of train.py, such as NAME and BATCH_SIZE.
2. The default setting runs normal MSE, but customMSE is defined within train.py, so it is not hard to change the criteria by yourself
3. Start training by simply type ...

```bash
python train.py
```

## Inference

1. Adjust the 3 important parameters at the top of demo.py.

- OUR_MODEL_WEIGHT_PATH: the file downloaded in Description-(3)
- INPUT_IMAGES_DIR: the unzipped directory downloaded in Description-(4)
- OUTPUT_VIDEO_DIR: the directory you would like the output images are put in

2. Then simply type ...

```bash
python demo.py
```

## Ploting learning curves

1. Make sure that all the history files (generated by train.py) are placed in history_xxx/ folder at current working directory, and then type ...

```bash
python plot_learning_curve.py
```
